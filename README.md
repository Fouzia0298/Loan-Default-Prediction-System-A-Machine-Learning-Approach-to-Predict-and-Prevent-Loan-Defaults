# Loan-Default-Prediction-System-A-Machine-Learning-Approach-to-Predict-and-Prevent-Loan-Defaults

## Overview
The **Loan Default Prediction System** is a machine learning-based solution designed to predict whether a borrower is likely to default on their loan. Using historical loan data, the system identifies patterns and risk factors associated with defaults, enabling lenders to make informed decisions and mitigate risks.

This project leverages advanced algorithms like **LightGBM**, **SVM**, and feature importance analysis to provide actionable insights into loan performance. It also includes tools for exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and model evaluation.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handles missing values, encodes categorical variables, and balances imbalanced datasets using SMOTE.
- **Feature Engineering**: Extracts meaningful features from raw data to improve model performance.
- **Machine Learning Models**: Implements state-of-the-art models such as LightGBM and SVM for accurate predictions.
- **SHAP Analysis**: Provides interpretable insights into model predictions using SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations).
- **Visualization**: Includes confusion matrices, feature importance plots, and SHAP summary plots for better understanding of results.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Lending Club**, a peer-to-peer lending platform. It contains detailed information about loan applicants, including:
- Loan amount (`loan_amnt`)
- Interest rate (`int_rate`)
- Borrower's annual income (`annual_inc`)
- Debt-to-income ratio (`dti`)
- Credit history (`delinq_2yrs`, `revol_util`, etc.)
- Loan status (`loan_status`)

## Usage
 - **Load Data**: Upload your loan dataset (e.g., LoanStats.csv) into the project directory.
 - **Preprocess Data** : Run the preprocessing pipeline to clean and prepare the data.
 - **Train Models** : Train machine learning models using the preprocessed data.
 - **Evaluate Results** : Analyze model performance metrics (e.g., precision, recall, F1-score) and interpret feature importance.
 - **Deploy Insights** : Use the trained model to predict loan defaults for new applicants.
